        <h3>Great to see you are interested in learning some more about the plants and our nature.</h3>
        <h4>Lets start with some of our most common flowers in fields:</h4>
        <p>On our open fields we have <strong>chicory</strong> which is a pretty common
         flower..</p> 
        <p>The exciting thing about Chicory is that you can eat it! The leaves are high in vitamins and minerals.</p>
        <p>You can eat the leaves as a vegetable or in a salad, but beware, they are very bitter tasting.</p>
        <p>The roots can also be boiled and eaten with butter. Sometimes the root is roasted and ground as a substitute or additive to coffee.</p>

        <p>We also have <strong>forget me not</strong>.</p>
        <p>The Forget-me-not is also known as the Scorpion Weed. The reason for this is because it has a coiled flower stalk like a tail of a scorpion.</p>
        <p> Some also say the name Forget-me-not comes from this plant’s unpleasant taste or odor, which is hard to forget.</p>

        <p>Next up we have <strong>Bee Balm</strong>.</p>
        <p>When this NATIVE flower is in full bloom, birds and insects can’t resist visiting the nectar-rich flowers.</p>
        <p> Many people claim that Bee Balm is so effective at drawing in hummingbirds that they no longer have to worry about filling their fur.</p>
